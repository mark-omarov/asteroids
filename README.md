## Roadmap

- [x] Add a scoring system
- [x] Implement multiple lives and respawning
- [ ] Add acceleration to the player movement
- [x] Add a background image
- [ ] Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- [ ] Make the player have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one

Maybe someday:

- [ ] Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- [ ] Create different weapon types
- [ ] Add a shield power-up
- [ ] Add a speed power-up
- [ ] Add bombs that can be dropped
